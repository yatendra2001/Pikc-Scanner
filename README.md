# Pikc

An app that let's you know if the product is harmful or not based on it's ingredients.

## Introduction

Designed and Developed a mobile application that scans ingredients behind the products and highlights all toxic ingredients. Integrated Google ML kit to retrieve texts from images. Got into Eureka Semi-finals and EY Scholarship finals with this idea.
